Output: 3
Explanation:
Factors of 9: 1, 3, 9
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Common Factors: 1, 3
Greatest common factor: 3 (GCD)

Example 2:
Input: N1 = 20, N2 = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15
Common Factors: 1, 5
Greatest common factor: 5 (GCD)
